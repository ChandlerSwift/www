## About

I'm a lifelong hacker (the
[good kind](http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/H/hacker.html)!). My parents
have a story they like to tell at my expense: At just a few years old, I was
interested enough in my Dad's laptop brought home from work one evening to
somehow manage to change the operating system language into German. Of course,
I vehemently deny everything. The interest in computers has stayed, though I
like to think I require a bit less supervision now, and I like to tinker with
hardware and software everything in between. Things I like include C and Go
and Linux and Assembly and MIDI and abusing hardware and...! Things I don't
like include: CSS. I run
[this software](https://github.com/chandlerswift/dotfiles) on
[this OS](/what-os.html) on
[this hardware](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/HMPTdm).
Ask me about my latest project!

As a musician I'm wrapping up a stint as the
[organist](https://youtu.be/31Ipq5v9T8E?t=3205)/[pianist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSH4ciadjDs)/[accompanist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byk43j57SeM)
at [Pilgrim Congregational Church in Duluth, MN](http://pilgrimduluth.org/),
and another as an accompanist for the [Lake Superior Youth Chorus](https://www.lsyouthchorus.org/).
When I'm in Duluth, I often play for [Jazz at Blush](https://www.facebook.com/JazzatBlush)
on Monday nights (and if you play an instrument, please come join us!).
I especially enjoy playing in small
[ensembles](https://youtu.be/rxqeobkiNgg?t=482)

as much as I can.

In my free time, I try to remain active with
[my Boy Scout troop](https://troop352.us/) (of which I am an Eagle Scout),
especially on outdoor activities. I enjoy reading science fiction, though I
don't have as much time for it as I might like. I appreciate
[XKCD](https://xkcd.com/) comics, especially
[about](https://xkcd.com/1760/)
[technology](https://xkcd.com/722/).

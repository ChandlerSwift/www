This is it: I'm finally going to finish
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) this year! (A strong
claim, given that this is my third attempt, but we'll see!) This year, I'm
planning to use this as an excuse to learn/relearn Emacs and Rust.

<!--more-->

I also started AoC in
[2020](https://github.com/ChandlerSwift/aoc/tree/main/2020) (19 stars; Python,
mostly) and [2021](https://github.com/ChandlerSwift/aoc/tree/main/aoc2021) (36
stars; Rust). Last year, I went in with the specific intention of learning Rust,
which honestly went pretty well; the challenges got more difficult at a pretty
similar rate to which the language grew more familiar, so I ended up spending a
pretty consistent amount of time on each day's challenge.

This year, I'm going to continue with Rust, but with a different learning
component: Emacs! I've been using Vim and VS Code as my primary editors for
quite a while now, but Emacs came back across my radar yesterday as I saw the
[news of the looming Emacs 29 release](https://blog.phundrak.com/emacs-29-what-can-we-expect/).
Lots of neat new features ([Eglot](https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot) for LSP
integration, and native Wayland support) make this a pretty exciting release.

I used Emacs a bit in school (it was the required text editor for our
second-semester CS class), so I'm not going in totally blind, but
I've...basically forgotten everything I ever knew. `C-X C-S` to save; `C-X C-C`
to exit? Arrow keys for navigation, type to insert text. That's literally it,
off the top of my head. That should get me through today, anyway; maybe tomorrow
I'll do the tutorial.

VS Code makes Rust easy; built-in syntax highlighting and good completion with
the [rust-analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/) extension really minimize
the amount of thinking I have to do. With Emacs, I won't be able to take the
same tab-completion mental shortcuts. That means I'll be relying a lot more
heavily on my knowledge of the language to carry me through, as well as
exploring some new editor features, which I'm excited about.

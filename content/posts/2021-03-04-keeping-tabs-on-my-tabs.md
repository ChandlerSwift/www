title: Keeping Tabs on my Tabs &ndash; a quick Python hack
IncludeSyntaxStyles: true
excerpt: I'm a bit of a tab hoarder. Firefox, thankfully, is pretty good about
    not using excessive resources for infrequently-accessed tabs, but when my
    <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tab-counter-webext/">Tab Counter extension</a>
    told me I'd topped 300 tabs, I figured it was time to start a more serious
    diet plan. And what's a diet without a scale? Here's a script that I use to
    keep track of how many tabs I have open at a time, so I can measure my
    progress in the fight against my hoarding instincts.

I'm a bit of a tab hoarder. Firefox, thankfully, is pretty good about not using
excessive resources for infrequently-accessed tabs, but when my
[Tab Counter extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tab-counter-webext/)
told me I'd topped 300 tabs, I figured it was time to start a more serious diet
plan. And what's a diet without a scale? Here's a script that I use to keep
track of how many tabs I have open at a time, so I can measure my progress in
the fight against my hoarding instincts.[^instincts]

[^instincts]: Generally, my usage consists of opening a bunch of tabs for a
    project, and closing them when I finish the project. This wouldn't be that
    big of a deal, considering that a good project is generally in the 20-30
    active tab range (generally consisting of documentation I'll want to refer
    back to, obscure forum threads where [DenverCoder9](https://xkcd.com/979/)
    mentioned my issue, API references, and of course some Stack Overflow tabs).
    However, this becomes a lot more of a problem when I'm swapping back and
    forth between several large projects, where I have a window for each.
    Currently, that list is:

     * DTANM - adding automated testing
     * Debugging screensharing on Wayland using Pipewire
     * Writing bare-metal Risc-V assembly
     * Fixing up an old super-tic-tac-toe server for better multiplayer
     * Finishing the Gallery app for AsteroidOS
     * Interfacing with MIDI instruments in Rust

    as well as a handful of smaller projects. One hope here is that this will
    be a nice kick in the pants to finish up some of those projects that have
    been sitting on the back burner for months.

Firefox[^currently] saves a `sessionstore` file that contains information about
your windows and tabs. Unfortunately, that seems to be only saved when the
browser is closed. However, Firefox also saves[^frequently] a
`$FIREFOX_PROFILE/sessionstore-backups/recovery.jsonlz4` with current data. This
is the file I used. `file` tells us that `.jsonlz4` is "Mozilla lz4
compressed data" -- apparently they're using a vaguely custom compression scheme
to store this data. I didn't have any luck stripping the header and
decompressing it with the standalone `lz4` tool, but Python proved workable.
Once I have the data, parsing it is fairly straightforward. I wound up running
the script once a day on a cronjob, frequently enough to give me that little
extra prod to close my tabs, and one day in...I've closed almost 30!

[^currently]: I'm not looking forward to the day when this changes and it breaks
    everything that relies on this partially-undocumented feature.

[^frequently]: It seems to save this file at least once a minute. I didn't
    really care if it was once a minute or once an hour, since my script runs
    daily; I just didn't want it to be "whenever you close your browser"!

```

Potential enhancements that'll probably never come since this was just a quick
evening project to scratch an itch I had:
 * Clean up the code, Chandler!
 * Rather than snapshotting the (reasonably large) file each time, save the
   relevant bits to a database
 * Make the tab matching more robust. Currently if I'm visiting example.com
   and click a link to example.org, the script thinks I closed example.com and
   opened example.org. However, since I do have access to each tab's history, I
   could reasonably easily modify the script to process this correctly. I
   actually got something mostly working here, but stripped it out since it
   made the output logic a lot more complex.
 * Add a trendline for the n-day trend (alternatively, a streak--"You've closed
   as many tabs as you've opened for N days in a row!")

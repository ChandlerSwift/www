Well, it's been a bit, but I'm thinking I might have a chance at finishing 2022
off before 2023 starts…if only just! Quite a few things have changed since last
time, not the least of which is this[^gnome-terminal-copy]:

[^gnome-terminal-copy]: I was (roughly) today years old when I learned Gnome
    terminal has
    [had a copy-to-html feature for years](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-terminal/-/commit/84f6f297d6dcecd1544f4e685ac85e21fbc7cdc9),
    and it works really nicely. (I simplified the output a bit, but the default
    would have been plenty workable.)

I'm doing most of my non-employer-affiliated development work on a
[StarFive VisionFive2](https://doc-en.rvspace.org/VisionFive2/Datasheet/VisionFive_2/introduction_ds.html)
these days (with a blog post likely to come at some point), and the transition
to RISC-V ended up being pretty straightforward.

<!--more-->

As always, I've been using Emacs and `magit`, but haven't gone out of my way to
introduce any new Emacs features this time.

I finally finished this today, but today was the fifth (I believe) major attempt
at cracking this particular problem. I solved the first part pretty quickly, but
the second part had me stymied for quite some time. My original goal was to find
a general solution for any cube net. I spent an evening with my friend Dustin
trying to reason about how cube folding worked; we determined that there were
eleven possible ways that a cube could unfold…and then promptly found [the
Wikipedia page for Nets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_(polyhedron)),
describing the eleven nets of a cube. Perhaps our drawing is more stylish?

![mspaint drawing of the eleven nets of a cube](/images/cube-nets.png)

But we weren't able to figure out a good algorithm for doing so. I tried a few
solutions that people had proposed in
[the r/adventofcode thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/zsct8w/2022_day_22_solutions/?sort=top),
but found that every solution I tried wasn't a true solution for every case, at
least as I understood it; Dustin and I always found a counterexample that broke
the solution for at least one orientation of at least one net.

<!-- For example, this solution _seemed_ right:

> The simplest explanation (for me) was to realize that the nearest
> edges are neighbours, with really only one exception: If the square
> is already a neighbour. Given that, I did a breadth-first search
> through all edges of all squares, and assigned the nearest unclaimed
> edge as its neighbouring edge.

But if my understanding of this explanation is right, it would fail to correctly
associate TODO -->

With that in mind, on attempt four I decided to hardcode the net to keep the
problem manageable. Despite that advantage, it still gave me some grief. I spent
several hours debugging the code, and fixed two off-by-one errors, one flipped
sign (which resulted in an edge being joined backwards, making a bit of a Möbius
cube edge), and an issue with incorrectly handling rotations when moving off the
edge of the net. Specifically, when the cursor moved off the edge, I updated the
`target_pos` and `orientation`, and if the `target_pos` was unobstructed, I
advanced, updating `pos` to `target_pos`. If it was obstructed, I didn't
advance. However, I didn't revert `orientation`, leading to an incorrect
orientation if I was doing all of these:

* Moving off the edge of the net to "warp" to another cube face
* Aiming for a space that was blocked
* Changing my orientation

This isn't frequent, but it does happen, and it cost me some serious debugging
time!

Anyway, the code ran a bit long, including a pretty lengthy handling of each
transition on each edge of the net. Check out the sweet inline net drawings in
the comments, though!

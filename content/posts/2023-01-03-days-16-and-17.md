Well, it's slow going. I was getting less than a day per day done, and now I'm
back at work, so that'll likely be even slower going forward. I'm retargeting
mid-January for the end. But here are the next couple days' worth!

<!--more-->

## Day 16

Not a particularly efficient implementation, but it works. We do a brute-force
breadth first search here, and come up with an answer in just under two seconds,
so I'm not too worried about optimization here. Both this and part 2 were run
with `-O` for a fairly reasonable speedup.

For part 2, I wasn't really sure what optimization I needed to do, if any. I
ended up spending the better part of a day getting some very subtle bugs worked
out of this one, so after that I was happy enough that it did terminate,
eventually. (Notably, after running for about twelve hours!) I think there's
likely some fairly low-hanging fruit if I prune some of the possible paths that
won't work out, but...I give up!

Oh, and notice that I had an uncaught integer overflow here--- I pretty quickly
tried more than 2**31 routes, so that resulted in the negative numbers seen

## Day 17

Part 1 was pretty straightforward. Part 2 would, as is typical, have needed
until approximately the heat death of the universe to terminate, so we had to
figure out a smarter approach. In this case, I just make note of every state,
and if we see it twice, we know that we loop. Then, note that cycle, and keep
applying that cycle until we're near the end, and finish as normal.

One thing I struggled with for a while today was data types. Rust's errors are
excellent for the simplest cases, but can quickly spiral out of control for more
complex errors. In my case, I had a lot of type errors, where I was trying to
add, say, a `usize` to a `u64` and put it in another `u64`. When stated like
that, the fix is pretty straightforward: Cast the `usize` to `u64` before doing
the addition. However, when that type is buried in the middle of a program, and
most of the types are inferred anyway, it's not immediately obvious which
variables' types I need to change to make things work out the way I want.

For a more concrete example, imagine that `height` returned a `u64` instead of a
`usize`[^which-i-did-elsewhere]:

[^which-i-did-elsewhere]: I did use `u64`s over `usize`s in a handful of places
    to try to write semi-portable code; many of the values in the second part
    were too large to fit in a 32-bit integer, so 32-bit platforms' 32-bit
    `usize` would overflow, where a `u64` is safe on all platforms. Turned out
    to be more hassle than it was worth, though!

             // Is there a better function here?

+            return i as u64 + 1;
         }
     }
 
```

The error here isn't too terrible, but it's not immediately obvious _why_ a
`u64` was expected. (In this case it's only a couple lines away, but during this
problem I solved some cases where there was an extensive chain of "`foo` is
`u64` because it's added to `bar` which is `u64` because it's cloned from `spam`
which is `u64` because that's what the `frobulate` function returns"-esque
shenanigans.)

Oh, and every time something went even slightly wrong, the compiler decided to
start calling the offsets `usize`s instead of `isize`s. I can't figure out what
was going on here, since solving other issues made it go away, but every time
any unrelated error popped up, this one would rear its ugly head too. I'm not
sure what's up with that! 🤷‍♂️

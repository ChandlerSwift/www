This is it: I'm finally going to finish
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) this year! (A strong
claim, given that this is my third attempt, but we'll see!) This year, I'm
planning to use this as an excuse to learn/relearn Emacs and Rust.

<!--more-->

I also started AoC in
[2020](https://github.com/ChandlerSwift/aoc/tree/main/2020) (19 stars; Python,
mostly) and [2021](https://github.com/ChandlerSwift/aoc/tree/main/aoc2021) (36
stars; Rust). Last year, I went in with the specific intention of learning Rust,
which honestly went pretty well; the challenges got more difficult at a pretty
similar rate to which the language grew more familiar, so I ended up spending a
pretty consistent amount of time on each day's challenge.

This year, I'm going to continue with Rust, but with a different learning
component: Emacs! I've been using Vim and VS Code as my primary editors for
quite a while now, but Emacs came back across my radar yesterday as I saw the
[news of the looming Emacs 29 release](https://blog.phundrak.com/emacs-29-what-can-we-expect/).
Lots of neat new features ([Eglot](https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot) for LSP
integration, and native Wayland support) make this a pretty exciting release.

I used Emacs a bit in school (it was the required text editor for our
second-semester CS class), so I'm not going in totally blind, but
I've...basically forgotten everything I ever knew. `C-X C-S` to save; `C-X C-C`
to exit? Arrow keys for navigation, type to insert text. That's literally it,
off the top of my head. That should get me through today, anyway; maybe tomorrow
I'll do the tutorial.

VS Code makes Rust easy; built-in syntax highlighting and good completion with
the [rust-analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/) extension really minimize
the amount of thinking I have to do. With Emacs, I won't be able to take the
same tab-completion mental shortcuts. That means I'll be relying a lot more
heavily on my knowledge of the language to carry me through, as well as
exploring some new editor features, which I'm excited about.

## Setting up a dev environment

I already had Rust installed from last year's attempt, so that's easy:
`rustup update stable` and I have the latest version ready to go. (I installed
`rustup` through my system's package manager, rather than the `curl | bash`
official install.)

Emacs 29 isn't stable, so the
[Arch package](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/emacs/) is currently
still on v28. The various versions in the AUR all appear to be tracking the
`master` branch, so I'm just going to go ahead and compile it myself. Apparently
I had all the dependencies installed, so that was as simple as:

```sh
git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/emacs.git
cd emacs
./configure --with-pgtk
make -j16
./src/emacs
```

Some notes: https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/2014/11/13/welcome-new-emacs-developers/

The `./configure` step could be left out, but then Emacs fails looking for an X
display. (I'm not entirely sure why it didn't use Xwayland, which I do have set
up.)

## Code
```rust
use std::fs;

fn main() {
    let data = fs::read_to_string("input.txt")
        .expect("Could not read input.txt");
    let data = data.trim();

    let mut highest_totals = vec![0, 0, 0];
    let mut current_total = 0;
    for line in data.split("\n") {
        if line == "" {
            // we've reached the end of an elf's food
            highest_totals.push(current_total);
            highest_totals.sort_by(|a, b| b.cmp(a));
            highest_totals.truncate(3);
            current_total = 0;
        } else {
            current_total += line.parse::<u32>().unwrap();
        }
    }
    highest_totals.push(current_total);
    highest_totals.sort_by(|a, b| b.cmp(a));
    highest_totals.truncate(3);
    println!("{:?}, sum: {}", highest_totals, highest_totals.iter().sum::<u32>());
}
```

## Notes
I'm using Emacs in GUI mode. I'll probably also explore the `-nw` option to run
it from a terminal.

Emacs didn't have any syntax highlighting for Rust in its default configuration.
I hear it has `tree-sitter` support as of v29, but I assume I need an extension
to make it support any particular language? Not sure; a project for tomorrow!

Indentation by default is pretty wonky; Emacs appears to default to a tab
inserting...three spaces? But then it replaces eight spaces with a tab? But
eight isn't a multiple of three? I fixed some indentation manually; tomorrow
I'll have to look a bit more into what's going on here. For today, I just fixed
things up manually with `rustfmt`.

I'm not entirely sure I understand what the `pgtk` stuff in Emacs means. I'll
have to check that out. More info here?
https://batsov.com/articles/2021/12/19/building-emacs-from-source-with-pgtk/

Here's where I wound up. Note that I don't have the faintest idea how to kill
the default intro buffer at the moment, and that I'm missing any kind of window
decorations (though `sway` adds its own for me; not shown here).

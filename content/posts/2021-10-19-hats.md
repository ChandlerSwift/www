As of about 11pm yesterday, I'm the proud owner of [0hats.com](https://0hats.com).

On Friday, I received a link to a document hosted on 17hats.com, which as far as
I can tell is some kind of CRM. 17 is a fun number[^fun-numbers], and the
concept of wearing 17 is [a silly one](https://xkcd.com/455/) and got a chuckle
out of me. On a whim, I checked if 19hats.com (the next largest prime quantity
of hats) was taken. It was. 23hats? Taken. 29hats? Also taken. Well then, what's
the smallest numbered hat quantity that I could register as my own domain?

A first attempt went something like this:
```
% for i in {1..50}; do dig ${i}hats.com | grep -i nxdomain >/dev/null && echo ${i}hats.com is available; done
5hats.com is available
16hats.com is available
26hats.com is available
28hats.com is available
30hats.com is available
35hats.com is available
36hats.com is available
37hats.com is available
41hats.com is available
43hats.com is available
44hats.com is available
46hats.com is available
48hats.com is available
49hats.com is available
%
```

(That's not exactly right, as 5hats.com _is_ registered, but doesn't have a DNS
entry associated with it.)

Anyway, I ended up getting well and truly [nerd sniped](https://xkcd.com/356/)
by the problem---how many of these are registered? What are they used for?
What's the smallest number of hats whose domain name I could own?

So a few hours of [Go code](https://github.com/ChandlerSwift/hats-domains)
later, [0hats.com](https://0hats.com) ~~graced~~ belabored the world with its
presence.

In short, for each domain from 0hats.com to some limit (I've chosen 50, rather
arbitrarily):

 * Checks if the domain is registered with a whois lookup, and if it is, notes
   the owner
 * Does a DNS lookup to see if there may be anything hosted at the site
 * Opens a geckodriver instances, browses to the page, grabs the title, and
   takes a screenshot.
 * and then renders the whole thing to one big list.

I've already snagged the smallest possible non-negative quantity of hats, but if
anyone is interested, 16hats.com is available at the time of writing!

I also did a very basic scan of {51..1000} hats; it seems that registrations
drop off pretty quickly after 50.
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/likexian/whois"
	whoisparser "github.com/likexian/whois-parser"
)

func main() {
	for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
		domainName := fmt.Sprintf("%vhats.com", i)
		// Check if domain is registered
		query_result, err := whois.Whois(domainName)
		if err != nil {
			panic(err)
		}
		_, err = whoisparser.Parse(query_result)
		if err == whoisparser.ErrNotFoundDomain {
			fmt.Println(domainName, " is available")
		} else if err != nil {
			panic(err)
		} else {
			fmt.Println(domainName, " is taken")
		}

	}

}
